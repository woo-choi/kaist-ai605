        "- Verify theoretically and empirically why gating mechanism (LSTM, GRU) helps in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n",
        "- Design an LSTM-based text classification model from scratch using PyTorch.\n",
        "- Apply the classification model to a popular classification task, Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST-2).\n",
        "- Achieve higher accuracy by applying common machine learning strategies, including Dropout.\n",
        "- Utilize pretrained word embedding (e.g. GloVe) to leverage self-supervision over a large text corpus.\n",
